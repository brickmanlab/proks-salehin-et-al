At each SNP position, the number of paternal and maternal allele was counted. The allele-specific origin of the transcripts (or allelic ratio) has been measured by the total number of reads mapped on the paternal genome divided by the total number of reads for each gene: allelic ratio = paternal reads / (paternal+maternal) reads.","Estimation of gene expression levels: To estimate the transcript abundance, count tables of gene expression were generated using HTSeq v0.6.1 software. Read counts are then normalized based on the amplification size of each transcript (RPRT for Reads Per Retro-Transcribed length per million mapped reads)",Genome_build: mm10,GPL17021,"Nicolas,,Servant",Nicolas.Servant@curie.fr,Institut Curie,26 rue d'ulm,Paris Cedex 05,75248,France,0,Illumina HiSeq 2500,cDNA,transcriptomic,RNA-Seq,BioSample: https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/biosample/SAMN05967685,SRA: https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/sra?term=SRX2320483,,NONE,,GSM2371539,,16C
