All embryos used in this study were obtained from natural mating.",total RNA,Dissociated single cells were transferred immediately into Smart-Seq2 single-cell lysis buffer and immediately frozen on dry ice.,Smart-Seq2 library was prepared as described in Picelli S et al. 2014.,10090,STAR alignment,Htseq-count,Genome_build: mm10,Supplementary_files_format_and_content: counts,GPL13112,"Giuliano,Giuseppe,Stirparo",giulianostirparo@gmail.com,Jeffrey Cheah Biomedical Centre,Wellcome MRC Cambridge Stem Cell,University of Cambridge,Puddicombe Way,Cambridge,Cambridgeshire,CB2 0AW,United Kingdom,0,Illumina HiSeq 2000,cDNA,transcriptomic,RNA-Seq,BioSample: https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/biosample/SAMN14573667,SRA: https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/sra?term=SRX8094583,NONE,,GSM4472040,,E3.75-ICM
