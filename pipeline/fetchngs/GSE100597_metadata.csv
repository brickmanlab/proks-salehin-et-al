Embryos at E4.5 were dissected from nascent decidua. The trophectoderm was eliminated from E3.5 and E4.5 by immunosurgery (Solter and Knowles, 1975). Embryos were incubated for 15-30 min in 20% anti mouse anti serum in N2B27 (made in house), rinsed 3 times in N2B27 and transferred to 20% freshly thawed rat serum in N2B27 for 15-30 min. Lysed trophectoderm was removed manually by repeated aspiration using a mouth-controlled finely drawn Pasteur pipette just bigger than the ICM. Isolated ICMs were placed individually in 20 µL drops of AccutaseTM in a bacteriological dish for at least 5 min until they assumed a blackberry-like appearance. They were transferred to similar sized drops of M2 and aspirated repeatedly using a very finely drawn Pasteur pipette to separate the cells. Cells were immediately placed individually into wells of lysis buffer and frozen. E5.5 embryos were dissected manually and were observed to be early E5.5 cells lacking distinct thickening of the visceral endoderm (pre-AVE migration). The extra embryonic ectoderm was removed using the tip of a pulled Pasteur pipette. The epiblast was separated from overlying visceral endoderm by aspiration, distal end first, with a pulled Pasteur pipette with diameter just bigger than the epiblast. Both epiblast and visceral endoderm were separately disaggregated and plated into wells as described above for ICMs.  E6.5 embryos were visually staged as early streak (Downs and Davies, 1993) and dissected from decidua in PBS and placed into M2 solution to remove extra embryonic tissues. Differences in dissection may contribute to different proportions of primitive streak and epiblast cells obtained at E6.5. The embryonic ectodermal portion of the early streak embryo was dissociated in drops of AccutaseTM at room temperature and upon partial digestion was fully dissociated by repeated aspiration using a very finely drawn, mouth controlled, siliconised glass needle.

Embryos at E4.5 were dissected from nascent decidua. The trophectoderm was eliminated from E3.5 and E4.5 by immunosurgery (Solter and Knowles, 1975). Embryos were incubated for 15-30 min in 20% anti mouse anti serum in N2B27 (made in house), rinsed 3 times in N2B27 and transferred to 20% freshly thawed rat serum in N2B27 for 15-30 min. Lysed trophectoderm was removed manually by repeated aspiration using a mouth-controlled finely drawn Pasteur pipette just bigger than the ICM. Isolated ICMs were placed individually in 20 µL drops of AccutaseTM in a bacteriological dish for at least 5 min until they assumed a blackberry-like appearance. They were transferred to similar sized drops of M2 and aspirated repeatedly using a very finely drawn Pasteur pipette to separate the cells. Cells were immediately placed individually into wells of lysis buffer and frozen. E5.5 embryos were dissected manually and were observed to be early E5.5 cells lacking distinct thickening of the visceral endoderm (pre-AVE migration). The extra embryonic ectoderm was removed using the tip of a pulled Pasteur pipette. The epiblast was separated from overlying visceral endoderm by aspiration, distal end first, with a pulled Pasteur pipette with diameter just bigger than the epiblast. Both epiblast and visceral endoderm were separately disaggregated and plated into wells as described above for ICMs.  E6.5 embryos were visually staged as early streak (Downs and Davies, 1993) and dissected from decidua in PBS and placed into M2 solution to remove extra embryonic tissues. Differences in dissection may contribute to different proportions of primitive streak and epiblast cells obtained at E6.5. The embryonic ectodermal portion of the early streak embryo was dissociated in drops of AccutaseTM at room temperature and upon partial digestion was fully dissociated by repeated aspiration using a very finely drawn, mouth controlled, siliconised glass needle.
